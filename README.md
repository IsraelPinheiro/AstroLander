# Astro Lander
Astro Lander is a Lunar Lander style game, made using Corona SDK, where you can select a space ship and try to land on different astronomical bodies. Here, gravity is your only enemy.
The game is aimed at everyone that likes space and it's misteries

## The Plot
As a lonely astronaut, while orbiting a planet (or moon) your space ship sufered a misterious malfunction, and now, your only escape is to take a lander and use it to get to the surface.

## Objectives
Just try to land safely, if that's not challenging enough for you, try landing on the special landing zones, getting you a multiplier for your final score

## Gameplay
As the game starts, the player can user the on-screen touch buttons to steer the lander and use its thruster (Which will consume fuel).
While the lander descents, the player has to manage its velocity, inclination and fuel consumption.
The player will make a successful landing if, when the lander touches the ground, it's sufficiently slow and leveled, otherwise, it will
explode, causing you a fiery death.
On a successful landing, your score will be determined by your landing spot and if it's a bonus zone.
